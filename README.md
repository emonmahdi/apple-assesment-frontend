This is a Assignment Project by VolumeZero Ltd.

## Setup

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emonmahdi/apple-assesment-frontend
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd professional
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

Once you have installed all the dependencies, you can run the following npm scripts:

- To start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

- To build the app for production:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This will build the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
